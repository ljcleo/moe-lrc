{"dataset": "arxiv", "prompt": "Introduction \\label{sec:intro}}\n\nSubluminous B stars (sdBs) show similar colours and spectral characteristics to main sequence stars of \nspectral type B, but are less luminous. Compared to main sequence B stars, the hydrogen Balmer lines in the spectra \nof sdBs are stronger while the helium lines are much weaker. The strong line broadening and the early confluence of the\nBalmer series is caused by the high surface gravities ($\\log\\,g\\simeq5.0-6.0$) of these compact stars \n($R_{\\rm sdB}\\simeq0.1-0.3\\,R_{\\rm \\odot}$). Subluminous B stars are considered to be core helium-burning stars with \nvery thin hydrogen envelopes and masses of about half a solar mass (Heber \\cite{heber86}) located at the extreme end of the horizontal branch (EHB). \n\n\\subsection{Hot subdwarf formation \\label{sec:formation}}\n\nThe origin of EHB stars is still unknown (see Heber\n\\cite{heber09} for a review). The key question is how all but a tiny fraction of the red-giant progenitor's hydrogen envelope was removed at the same time at which the helium core has attained the mass ($\\simeq0.5\\,M_{\\rm \\odot}$) to ignite the helium flash. The reason for this high mass loss at the tip of the red giant branch (RGB) is unclear. Several single-star"}

He considered that the championship title was still unpredictable as the season is still going on.\nManchester United’s winning streak continues. Playing Manchester City at Old Trafford, Marcus Rashford and his team won a narrow 2-1 victory.\nThese results put Man United in third place in the standings with 38 points. The Red Devils are only one point behind Manchester City in the second post. Meanwhile, Arsenal are at the top of the standings with 44 points with one game less.\nInevitably, Man United began to be predicted as a team that has the opportunity to win a trophy this season. Moreover, the Red Devils players began to understand Erik ten Hag’s tactics.\nEven so, Ten Hag was reluctant. He feels there is still a long way to go to win the Premier League.\n“Right now, we are talking about the title in January. We haven’t even had half a season and there are still many games to come,” Ten Hag told Manchester United’s official website.\n“There are still a lot of games. There’s a lot of work to be done.
